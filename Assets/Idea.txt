Main mechanic: Failure is progress
- You control the growth of a plant that uses energy points to grow
- Every time you fail, the plant dies and its energy drops down back into the pot
- Upon every failure, you end up with more energy to use next time

think ive figured out the core mechanic:
you spend a point (or two or whatever) to place a stem or a leaf.
stems can only go so far without a leaf, and will turn light brown the further they get
placing leaves increases the level of adjacent stems (more green)
when you cannot go any further (out of energy), your only option is to 'Perish'
you can always choose to 'Perish' if at least one stem is placed
when you 'Perish' your stems all drop down back into the pot (maybe gravity until they get low enough and then gravitate toward the pot)
for each stem that falls into the pot, you gain energy based on the stems level (how green/hydrated/whatever)
after perishing (does not have to be after all stems recollected), you may 'Resprout' and begin again
therefor, each growth provides the player with more energy, until they have enough to reach the end
